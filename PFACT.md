##PFACT##

See also [attribute](attribute.md), [fact](fact.md), and [property](property.md).

\[[BG](SOURCES.md#BG)\] 
Acronym of "Property, Fact, Attribute, Characteristic, or Trait". Coined by T. Wetmore, of the [BetterGEDCOM](BetterGEDCOM.md) effort, in an attempt to help avoid confusion caused by the use of these many synonyms for the same concept. Conveniently pronounceable as "fact."
