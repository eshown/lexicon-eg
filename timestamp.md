\[[STEMMA2](SOURCES.md#STEMMA2)\] In the context of STEMMA, this refers to the POSIX-like or UNIX-like interpretation which is an offset from a fixed time called the [epoch](epoch.md). Javaâ€™s Date class uses this representation and it means that its values are then locale-independent, and unaffected by either [TZ](time zone.md) or[DST](daylight saving time.md).
