##entity-relationship model (ER)##

\[[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model) 2014-10-24\] A data model for describing the data or information aspects of a business domain or its process requirements, in an abstract way that lends itself to ultimately being implemented in a database such as a relational database. The main components of ER models are entities (things) and the relationships that can exist among them, and databases.
