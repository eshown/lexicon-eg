##place hierarchy##

\[[STEMMA](SOURCES.md#STEMMA)\] A description of a [place](place.md) in which each component of the reference is linked to a parent *place* with a broader context, e.g. house to street, to town, to county, to state, to country. See [A Place for Everything](http://parallax-viewpoint.blogspot.com/2013/08/a-place-for-everything.html).

\[[BG](SOURCES.md#BG)\] A place may be located within other higher level places covering larger areas, which may themselves be located in even higher level places, forming a hierarchy. The highest level in the hierarchy is often a country, and the lowest for example a farm. A place may be a member of several hierarchies, often defined by different organizations in public administration. Hierarchies may change over time, e.g. when a local place is included in another country, but the local place does per definition stay the same. Place Hierarchies may be represented in data models, databases and files.
