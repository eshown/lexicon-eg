##RFC##

\[[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments) 2014-10-05\] A Request for Comments (RFC) is a publication of the Internet Engineering Task Force ([IETF](IETF.md)) and the Internet Society, the principal technical development and standards-setting bodies for the Internet.

An RFC is authored by engineers and computer scientists in the form of a memorandum describing methods, behaviors, research, or innovations applicable to the working of the Internet and Internet-connected systems. It is submitted either for peer review or simply to convey new concepts, information, or (occasionally) engineering humor. The IETF adopts some of the proposals published as RFCs as Internet standards.
