##synchronized dates (UK: synchronised dates)##

\[[STEMMA2](SOURCES.md#STEMMA2)\] The general case of a situation where a point in time is described by two or more dates, expressed in different calendars. This includes the Julian/Gregorian [dual dating](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_dating), often called *double dating* but not to be confused with the social engagement of the same name.
