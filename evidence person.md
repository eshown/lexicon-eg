##evidence person##

See also [Persona](persona.md), and [conclusion person](conclusion person.md).

\[[BG](SOURCES.md#BG)\] Created when working to an [Evidence and Conclusion Model](evidence and conclusion model.md). This represents the evidence going into an analysis stage. An Evidence Person is created in the same format as a real life person would be under the [Conclusion-only Model](conclusion-only model.md) but contains only the data known at that time and will not be updated later. The lowest level of Evidence Person contains data extracted from a *single* source record.
