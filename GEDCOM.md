##GEDCOM##

\[[EE](SOURCES.md#EE)\]  An acronym used for the GEnealogy Data COMmunications file format developed by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to allow the exchange of genealogical databases between various data-management programs.

\[[BG](SOURCES.md#BG)\]  (from [FamilySearch Developer Network](FamilySearch Developer Network.md), the body that originally developed GEDCOM): "GEDCOM stands for GEnealogical Data COMmunications and is a file format specification that allows different genealogical software programs to share data with each other. It was developed by the Family and Church History Department of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to provide a flexible, uniform format for exchanging computerized genealogical data. This standard is supported by [FamilySearch](FamilySearch.md), by the family history products that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints produces, as well as by the vendors of most of the major genealogical software products."
