\[[EE](SOURCES.md#EE)\]  A volume of correspondence, created by the letterpress process in which a writer would insert a freshly inked letter into a bound volume of blank tissue pages and, after moistening the adjacent tissue, fasten the closed book with its attached screws; when the book was reopened, the transferred ink could then be read through the tissue onto which it had been imposed.
