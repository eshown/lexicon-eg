##conclusion-only model (or data model)##

\[[BG](SOURCES.md#BG)\] During the [Evidence and Conclusion Process](evidence and conclusion process.md), the researcher may (in best practice, *should*) document the individual steps. When using a *Conclusion-only Model*, the researcher will document their selected evidence, analyses and conclusions as text. The conclusions are entered into the application's database, superseding any prior inferior conclusion, so that a person's current data represents the latest, overall working hypothesis derived from all the available evidence. Working to a Conclusion-only Model *tends* to minimise the number of conclusions for an item, e.g. just one Birth event is *usually* recorded for an individual. Working to an Evidence and Conclusion Model will result in as many Birth Events per real-life person as there have been analyses.
