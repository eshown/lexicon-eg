##Web 2.0##

\[[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0) 2014-10-04\] Term commonly associated with web applications that facilitate interactive information sharing, interoperability, user-centered design, and collaboration on the World Wide Web. A Web 2.0 site gives its users the free choice to interact or collaborate with each other in a social media dialogue as creators (*prosumer*) of user-generated content in a virtual community, in contrast to websites where users (consumer) are limited to the passive viewing of content that was created for them. Examples of Web 2.0 include *social-networking sites*, *blogs*, *wikis*, *video-sharing sites*, *hosted services*, *web applications*, *mashups*, and *folksonomies*.
