\[[ODO](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/event) 2014-10-02\] A thing that happens or takes place, especially one of importance.

\[[STEMMA](SOURCES.md#STEMMA)\] In everyday life, an event is something that happened at a particular place and time, or over a span of time. The Event [entity](entity.md), though, represents a date, or range of dates, for which source information exists. See [simple Event](simple event.md), [protracted Event](protracted event.md), and [hierarchical Event](hierarchical event.md).

\[[Gramps](SOURCES.md#Gramps)\] A defining moment in a person's life. See events for the use in genealogy, for predefined events in Gramps and suggested naming for common events.

\[[BG](SOURCES.md#BG)\] An Event is something that happens in the real world at one or more places and at a time or over a period of time. Events of genealogical significance usually involve Persons who often play specific roles with respect to the Event. Some Events, such as birth or marriage, establish Relationships between Persons. Some genealogical Models include Events as an Entity, some include them as Attributes of the Person or other Entities, and some include them both ways. Analogous to Models, the computer representations of Events can be as separate Records or as Field within Records.

\[[GEDCOM-X](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/conceptual-model-specification.md#events-vs-facts) 2014-10-23\] An occurrence that happened at a specific time or period of time, often at a specific place or set of places. Genealogically relevant events are often described by referencing the persons that played a role in that event. Hence events often refer to persons and might infer relationships, but events are described independently of those persons and relationships. See also [fact](fact.md).
