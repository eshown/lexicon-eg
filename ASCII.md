##ASCII##

\[[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) 2014-10-04\] American Standard Code for Information Interchange. A character-encoding scheme originally based on the English alphabet that encodes 128 specified characters — the numbers 0-9, the letters a-z and A-Z, some basic punctuation symbols, some control codes that originated with Teletype machines, and a blank space — into the 7-bit binary integers.
