##IETF##

\[[BG](SOURCES.md#BG)\] [Internet Engineering Task Force](http://www.ietf.org/) â€” An international standards body not affiliated with ISO which governs most technical standards for the internet. IETF takes a developmental approach to standards rather than the codified approach preferred by the ISO and thus remains a more flexible, nimble body more suited to the needs of internet-based technologies.
