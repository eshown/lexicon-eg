\[[EE](SOURCES.md#EE)\]  A presumed reality—an event, circumstance, or other detail that is considered to have happened or to be true. In historical research, it is difficult to establish *actual* truths; therefore, the validity of any stated “fact” rests upon the quality of the evidence presented to support it.
