\[[ODO](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/fact) 2013-12-24) A thing that is known or proved to be true.

\[[EE](SOURCES.md#EE)\]  A presumed reality—an event, circumstance, or other detail that is considered to have happened or to be true. In historical research, it is difficult to establish *actual* truths; therefore, the validity of any stated “fact” rests upon the quality of the evidence presented to support it.

\[[BG](SOURCES.md#BG)\] An item of information. In a [Model](data model.md) the Attribute Values of [Entity](entity.md) instances are Facts, and the existence of the Entity instances themselves are Facts. In computer representations Records and Fields are Facts. Basically everything is a Fact, so the term is not useful in distinguishing any one thing from any other.

\[[GEDCOM-X](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/conceptual-model-specification.md#events-vs-facts) 2014-10-23\] A data item that is presumed to be true about a specific subject, such as a person or relationship. A time or place is often, but not always, applicable to a fact. Facts do not exist outside the scope of the subject to which they apply. See also [event](event.md).
