##date##

\[[STEMMA2](SOURCES.md#STEMMA2)\] A measurement of the passing of days. Dates are reckoned according to a [calendar](calendar.md).

\[[Gramps](SOURCES.md#Gramps)\] (sec. obj.) Dates in Gramps are much more complex than just a month, day, and year. Dates are always in a particular calendar, can span a time frame, can be approximate, and have support for many other subtleties specific to genealogy data.
