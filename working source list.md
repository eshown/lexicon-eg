##working source list##

\[[EE](SOURCES.md#EE)\]  A list of sources consulted or to be consulted in a research project. A working source list typically contains descriptive or analytical details that will not be published in a final bibliography, unless the final work presents an *annotated* bibliography. A working source list may also contain references that will not be considered valid or appropriate to the final research product.
