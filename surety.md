Definition from the TMG Glossary: *A numerical value assigned to indicate the quality of a source in documenting a given fact recorded in the data set. The surety values are recorded in the citation record. The values are:*
 * 3= an original source, close in time to the event
 * 2= a reliable secondary source
 * 1= a less reliable secondary source or an assumption based on other facts in a source
 * 0= a guess
 * -= the source does not support the information cited or this information has been disproved

About Surety, from the TMG Help file topic "GEDCOM export":

*Sureties: When this option is selected, surety values are exported to the extent supported by GEDCOM. Date, place, and memo sureties are exported with a QUAY tag at one level higher (usually 4) than the source citation from which they are referenced.*
