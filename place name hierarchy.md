See also [Place Hierarchy Path](place hierarchy path.md).

\[[BG](SOURCES.md#BG)\] A place hierarchy is identified by the names (and optionally types) of the places in the hierarchy during a certain period of time, a Place Name Hierarchy, often found in sources and/or implied by the geographic area covered by the source itself. Place Name Hierarchies can be represented in the current Gedcom by a comma-separated list of names. A hierarchy of names of higher level places provides an additional context for the identification of a place by name, but there could be cases where the hierarchy of names does not identify the higher level context uniquely. Place Name Hierarchies may be represented in data models, databases and files.
