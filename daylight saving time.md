##daylight saving time (DST)##

\[[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time) 2014-10-03\] The practice of advancing clocks during summer months (that feature more daylight) so that people get up earlier in the morning and experience more daylight in the evening. Typically, users of DST adjust clocks forward one hour near the start of spring and adjust them backward in the autumn.

\[[STEMMA2](SOURCES.md#STEMMA2)\] The annual adjustment of clocks in a given TZ to increase the daylight hours in the evening and so reduce those in the morning.
