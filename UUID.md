##UUID##

\[[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) 2014-10-04\] Universally Unique Identifier. An identifier standard used in software construction, standardized by the Open Software Foundation (OSF) as part of the Distributed Computing Environment (DCE). The intent of UUIDs is to enable distributed systems to uniquely identify information without significant central coordination. Thus, anyone can create a UUID and use it to identify something with reasonable confidence that the identifier will never be unintentionally used by anyone for anything else
