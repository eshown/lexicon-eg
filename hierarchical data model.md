##hierarchical data model##

\[[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_database_model) 2014-10-05\] A [data model](data model.md) in which the data is organized into a tree-like structure. The data is stored as records which are connected to one another through links. A record is a collection of fields, with each field containing only one value. The entity type of a record defines which fields the record contains. A record in the hierarchical database model corresponds to a row (or tuple) in the relational database model and an entity type corresponds to a table (or relation).
