##initialism##

\[[EE](SOURCES.md#EE)\]  A coined “word” created by combining the initial letter(s) of several words to identify a thing, place, or concept. Initialisms are written in all capital letters (or, by the canons of topography, in small capital letters), without periods between letters. Unlike acronyms, when an initialism is spoken, individual letters are pronounced. *Examples*: FHL for the Family History Library; or OAH for the Organization of American Historians.
